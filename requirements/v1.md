## **Project Details**

**Build a platform that enables companies to create and deploy customer support AI agent chatbots on their own websites, via a simple script integration.**


---

## **Task Overview**

Develop a web-based dashboard where companies can:

* Sign up and manage their account  
* Configure a custom AI chatbot agent by:
  * Uploading or entering support instructions / knowledge base content (markdown, text, URLs, or FAQ entries)
  * Setting tone/personality preferences (e.g., formal, friendly, humorous)
  * Defining key intents or special-case instructions (e.g., escalate billing issues, avoid legal advice)  
* Generate an embeddable script (like Intercom or Drift) to add the chatbot widget to their marketing site  
* View analytics and conversation logs with optional feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down, comments)

The embedded chatbot should:

* Be branded to match the companyâ€™s color scheme and logo  
* Answer customer queries using only the company-provided knowledge base and instructions  
* Escalate to human support or email capture when it cannot answer  
* Respond in real-time with minimal latency  
* Support multi-turn conversations with context awareness

## **Performance Requirements**

* Embeddable widget must load fast (target: < 1s) and work on all major modern browsers  
* AI agent should respond to most queries in under 2 seconds  
* Dashboard must support simultaneous access by multiple users in a company (multi-tenant architecture)  
* Handle high-concurrency scenarios (e.g., 1000+ simultaneous users across different embedded instances)

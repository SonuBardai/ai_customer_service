## **Project Details**

**Build a platform that enables companies to create and deploy customer support AI Agent chatbots on their own websites, via a simple script integration.**

---

## **MVP Scope**

### **Task Overview**

Develop a web-based dashboard where companies can:

* Sign up and manage their account  
* Configure a custom AI chatbot agent by:
  * Uploading or entering support instructions (text or markdown only for MVP)
  * Setting tone/personality preferences (e.g., formal, friendly)
* Generate an embeddable script (like Intercom or Drift) to add the chatbot widget to their marketing site  
* View basic analytics and recent conversation logs with optional thumbs up/down feedback

The embedded chatbot should:

* Be branded to match the company’s color scheme and logo  
* Answer customer queries using only the company-provided knowledge base and instructions  
* Escalate to email capture or fallback message when it cannot answer  
* Respond in real-time with minimal latency  
* Support basic multi-turn conversations with short-term context awareness

---

### **Performance Requirements**

* Embeddable widget must load fast (target: < 1s) and work on all major modern browsers  
* AI agent should respond to most queries in under 2 seconds  
* Dashboard must support simultaneous access by multiple users in a company (multi-tenant architecture)  
* Handle high-concurrency scenarios (e.g., 1000+ simultaneous users across different embedded instances)

---

### **Security and Abuse Prevention (MVP)**

* **Rate Limiting**  
  * Per-IP rate limits with optional exponential backoff

* **Origin Verification**  
  * Widget works only from domains whitelisted in the dashboard

* **Prompt Injection Mitigation**  
  * Basic input sanitization and prompt isolation

* **Data Isolation**  
  * Multi-tenant backend with scoped access to each company’s data

---

### **Evaluation Criteria (MVP)**

#### **Code Quality and Architecture**

* Modular architecture separating frontend (React), backend (Django + NoSql), and chatbot logic  
* Secure handling of tenant data with clean separation between accounts  

#### **Latency Optimization**

* Lazy-loaded embeddable script  
* Use of streaming or chunked replies via the API

#### **AI Accuracy and Control**

* Retrieval-based prompting or direct embedding search on uploaded instructions  
* Restrict chatbot responses to client-provided knowledge only  

#### **User Experience**

* Minimal, polished dashboard UI  
* Real-time preview of chatbot answers in dashboard  
* Basic logs and feedback tools

## **Post-MVP Features**

These are important enhancements to be added in future versions once core product stability is proven.

### **Chatbot Configuration Enhancements**

* Accept knowledge base input via:
  * URLs  
  * PDFs  
  * Notion page imports  
  * FAQ template or structured schema  
* More granular tone/personality customization  
* Special-case handling (e.g., “avoid legal advice”, escalate billing issues)  

### **Advanced Chatbot Capabilities**

* Persistent memory and deeper context tracking  
* More sophisticated fallback/escalation (e.g., hand off to Slack, Intercom, Zendesk)
* AI behavior versioning when instructions are changed  
* Behavior variation for different clients even on shared infrastructure  

### **Advanced Security and Controls**

* Signed embed tokens with expiration  
* CAPTCHA for abuse  
* Audit trail of suspicious activity  
* Role-based access controls for dashboard users  
* IP logging (optional)

---

### **Third-Party Integrations (Post-MVP)**

* **Slack**  
  * Escalated chats and alerts to Slack channels  
  * Trigger configuration UI in dashboard

* **Notion**  
  * Push unresolved queries or feedback to Notion DB  
  * Import knowledge from Notion pages  

* **Zapier / Webhooks**  
  * Custom event hooks for integrations (e.g., failed intents, captured leads)  
  * Retry and payload configuration

* **Future Targets:**  
  * Intercom / Zendesk (for hybrid handoff)  
  * Google Sheets or Airtable  
  * Email alerts via SMTP or API  

---

### **Stretch Goals**

* Multilingual support  
* CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce)  
* GPT fine-tuning or vector embeddings per client  
* Export data and analytics as CSV or API
